# ESerm

A microblogging form of journaling. Written in Rust as a learning experiment.

Many journaling programs are better-designed for writing long entries. Of course, they do not force you to do so, but they certainly make it preferable to do it that way.

This is different. This is a tool for writing out your thoughts Twitter-style, with a CLI for managing, writing, and editing posts.

This is currently under development, so there are no promises to its completeless or stability at the moment.
