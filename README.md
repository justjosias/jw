# ESerm

Digital sticky notes on steroids. Written in Rust as a learning experiment.

Many journaling programs are better-designed for writing long entries. Of course, they do not force you to do so, but they certainly make it preferable to do it that way.

This is different. This is a tool for writing out your thoughts Twitter-style, with a CLI for managing, writing, and editing posts.

Writing out quick thoughts in quick post-format is what this tool is about. I am writing this for myself to be able to keep track of my thoughts in the past, as it can be quite helpful in the future in so many ways. 

This is currently under development, so there are no promises to its completeless or stability at the moment.

Future features:

- Full text search
- Categories and hashtags
- Encryption

todo:
- Yaml metadata at top
- Handle bad text in filenames (strip more than whitespace in write_file)
- Rewrite when I know what I'm doing

## Word meanings

I chose specific meanings for different words used throughout this program.

First of all, the name. ESerm is short for Ego Sermo, which is a combination of the Latin words for "self" and "conversation."

Next, we don't have tweets, toots, or even posts. Here thoughts you save are called "cogs", which is short for "cogitatio", "cogitamentum", or "cogitatus" (take your pick). "To post" is "puto".

Yes, I used random Latin words that only sort of refer to what I want them to be. It is a personal project, and if you don't like my naming, change the words yourself.
